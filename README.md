# LEMAY.AI INTERVIEW ANSWERS
Hello, 

Your goal is to demonstrate your coding skills by creating a video recording of your answers to some general knowledge questions, writing an ML API demo using Docker, python3, and a bit of magic, and showing us your exploratory data analysis skills. Please spend minimal effort on graphics and UI, as this is not a test of your UI coding skills. Just don't stress on frontend stuff.

# 1) GENERAL KNOWLEDGE VIDEO DEMONSTRATION AND TECHNICAL WRITING SAMPLE
- The writing samples is provided as all_recent_publications.pdf file in the repo.
- The answers to the interview questions are provided in the same .ipynb file. The video will be mailed.

# 2) MODEL DEPLOYMENT DEMONSTRATION
- The Bert-base-multilingual-uncased model finetuned for sentiment analysis on product reviews in six languages: English, Dutch, German, French, Spanish and Italian is chosen for deployment. It predicts the sentiment of the review as a number of stars. It provides sentiment in different languages and a complex model so it was chosen for deployment.
- The model is deployed using a docker container. The application can also be tested by running wsgi.py file from Problem-2/app folder. The API can also be tested from API_test.ipynb file.

# 3) EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATION
- The emotion dataset was used for EDA as I have also worked on similar data in the past.
- The steps and explianation for EDA is also provided in the .ipynb file of problem-3 folder.
